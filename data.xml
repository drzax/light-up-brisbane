The Zonta Club of Brisbane East Inc, a member of Zonta International, raises funds annually to support local projects towards a common goal &amp;ndash; to improve the legal, educational, economic, political and health status of women. The Club is not for profit, run by volunteers and all funds raised are directed to projects, such as educational scholarships for women, support to women refuges and support services such as Brisbane Domestic Violence Service. Annually the Zonta Clubs of Brisbane conduct a campaign, under the Banner Zonta Says No to Violence against Women, to raise awareness of domestic and family violence in the community and to support women and their children when they find themselves in such a situation. It is proposed to Paint Brisbane Orange by lighting up key bridges and buildings and to engage the Brisbane community to join the campaign. A walk will be held on the night of the light up.

For more than 60 years, the Trust&amp;rsquo;s fundraising efforts have improved the wellbeing of the most marginalised, vulnerable members of the Brisbane community. Established in the 1960s, the Trust continues the good work of the Lord Mayor whose mission is to improve the liveability of all Brisbane residents. The Trust&amp;rsquo;s work supports charities that assist people suffering from disability, homelessness, mental illness, drug or alcohol addiction, trauma, abuse or neglect. The annual Christmas Appeal raises funds for our Christmas grant where charities apply for toys, Foodbank food vouchers or to host a client Christmas party.

For more than 60 years, the Trust&amp;rsquo;s fundraising efforts have improved the wellbeing of the most marginalised, vulnerable members of the Brisbane community. Established in the 1960s, the Trust continues the good work of the Lord Mayor whose mission is to improve the liveability of all Brisbane residents. The Trust&amp;rsquo;s work supports charities that assist people suffering from disability, homelessness, mental illness, drug or alcohol addiction, trauma, abuse or neglect. The annual Christmas Appeal raises funds for our Christmas grant where charities apply for toys, Foodbank food vouchers or to host a client Christmas party.

This Light Up is organised by: Lord Mayor&amp;#39;s Charitable Trust</xCal:description>
