Be Bold. Be Brave. Be Brisbane. We believe that a Festival should be festive and celebrate the personality of its city. Brisbane Festival is unlike anything else you can experience in the world. We redefine what an International Arts Festival looks and feels like, staying ahead of the game and bringing the next generation with us. The river and iconic city landmarks are our stage as we create the art that enlivens, delights and disrupts. The curated multi-arts program presents a bold international program transporting our audience beyond the everyday through captivating performances and installations from across the world. We participate in global conversations. Brisbane is a city with boundless ambition, and the program celebrates this through collaborations, commissions and presentations.

Be Bold. Be Brave. Be Brisbane. We believe that a Festival should be festive and celebrate the personality of its city. Brisbane Festival is unlike anything else you can experience in the world. We redefine what an International Arts Festival looks and feels like, staying ahead of the game and bringing the next generation with us. The river and iconic city landmarks are our stage as we create the art that enlivens, delights and disrupts. The curated multi-arts program presents a bold international program transporting our audience beyond the everyday through captivating performances and installations from across the world. We participate in global conversations. Brisbane is a city with boundless ambition, and the program celebrates this through collaborations, commissions and presentations.

Be Bold. Be Brave. Be Brisbane. We believe that a Festival should be festive and celebrate the personality of its city. Brisbane Festival is unlike anything else you can experience in the world. We redefine what an International Arts Festival looks and feels like, staying ahead of the game and bringing the next generation with us. The river and iconic city landmarks are our stage as we create the art that enlivens, delights and disrupts. The curated multi-arts program presents a bold international program transporting our audience beyond the everyday through captivating performances and installations from across the world. We participate in global conversations. Brisbane is a city with boundless ambition, and the program celebrates this through collaborations, commissions and presentations.

Be Bold. Be Brave. Be Brisbane. We believe that a Festival should be festive and celebrate the personality of its city. Brisbane Festival is unlike anything else you can experience in the world. We redefine what an International Arts Festival looks and feels like, staying ahead of the game and bringing the next generation with us. The river and iconic city landmarks are our stage as we create the art that enlivens, delights and disrupts. The curated multi-arts program presents a bold international program transporting our audience beyond the everyday through captivating performances and installations from across the world. We participate in global conversations. Brisbane is a city with boundless ambition, and the program celebrates this through collaborations, commissions and presentations.

			<description>Thursday, September 12, 2024 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Tropical Dome will be lit Pink to celebrate Brisbane Festival.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be Bold. Be Brave. Be Brisbane. We believe that a Festival should be festive and celebrate the personality of its city. Brisbane Festival is unlike anything else you can experience in the world. We redefine what an International Arts Festival looks and feels like, staying ahead of the game and bringing the next generation with us. The river and iconic city landmarks are our stage as we create the art that enlivens, delights and disrupts. The curated multi-arts program presents a bold international program transporting our audience beyond the everyday through captivating performances and installations from across the world. We participate in global conversations. Brisbane is a city with boundless ambition, and the program celebrates this through collaborations, commissions and presentations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Light Up is organised by: Major Brisbane Festivals Ltd &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Venue&lt;/b&gt;:&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="javascript:Nav(&amp;#39;objectid=1244421&amp;amp;objecttype=19243&amp;amp;seotitle=Tropical-Display-Dome-Brisbane-Botanic-Gardens-Mt-Coot-tha&amp;amp;key=0bb792cf0884de23cee297d0adf34e94&amp;amp;view=object&amp;amp;-childview=&amp;amp;-index=&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;detailBase&amp;#39;)"&gt;Tropical Display Dome, Brisbane Botanic Gardens Mt Coot-tha&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Venue address&lt;/b&gt;:&amp;nbsp;Brisbane Botanic Gardens Mt Coot-tha, 152 Mt Coot-tha Road, Toowong</description>

Be Bold. Be Brave. Be Brisbane. We believe that a Festival should be festive and celebrate the personality of its city. Brisbane Festival is unlike anything else you can experience in the world. We redefine what an International Arts Festival looks and feels like, staying ahead of the game and bringing the next generation with us. The river and iconic city landmarks are our stage as we create the art that enlivens, delights and disrupts. The curated multi-arts program presents a bold international program transporting our audience beyond the everyday through captivating performances and installations from across the world. We participate in global conversations. Brisbane is a city with boundless ambition, and the program celebrates this through collaborations, commissions and presentations.
