			<description>Wednesday, November 29, 2023 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Reddacliff Place sculptures will be lit Pink to support Founder&amp;#39;s Day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On Founder&amp;#8217;s Day swara celebrates the lives and what would have been the 100th birthday of the wonderful Pink Twins and founders - Dorothy and Moyia O&amp;#8217;Brien. The Pink twins were the first two female occupational therapists in Australia, with a passion for the colour pink which led to their affectionate nickname of &amp;#8216;The Pink Twins&amp;#8217;. Swara was founded by the Pink Twins in 1975 when they retired from occupational therapy, after they noticed the gap in the healthcare system for individuals with disabilities.

For more than 60 years, the Trust&amp;rsquo;s fundraising efforts have improved the wellbeing of the most marginalised, vulnerable members of the Brisbane community. Established in the 1960s, the Trust continues the good work of the Lord Mayor whose mission is to improve the liveability of all Brisbane residents. The Trust&amp;rsquo;s work supports charities that assist people suffering from disability, homelessness, mental illness, drug or alcohol addiction, trauma, abuse or neglect. The annual Christmas Appeal raises funds for our Christmas grant where charities apply for toys, Foodbank food vouchers or to host a client Christmas party.
