			<xCal:description>The Victoria Bridge will be lit Purple to support The Lord Mayor&amp;#39;s Charitable Trust Christmas Appeal.

For more than 70 years, the Trust&amp;rsquo;s fundraising efforts have improved the wellbeing of the most marginalised, vulnerable members of the Brisbane community. Established in the 1960s, the Trust continues the good work of the Lord Mayor whose mission is to improve the liveability of all Brisbane residents. The Trust&amp;rsquo;s work supports charities that assist people suffering from disability, homelessness, mental illness, drug or alcohol addiction, trauma, abuse or neglect. The annual Christmas Appeal raises funds for our Christmas grants where charities apply to help vital community services and grassroots initiatives, particularly at Christmas.

Pancreatic cancer is currently responsible for the 3rd highest amount of cancer deaths, and thus is an extremely deadly cancer in Australia. On this day, we are asking venues across the globe to turn purple to honour those lost to pancreatic cancer or currently fighting, as well as raise important awareness for this disease. With only a 12.5% chance of survival beyond 5 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Light Up is organised by: Pankind</description>

			<xCal:description>The Story Bridge will be lit Purple to support Pancreatic Cancer Awareness Month.

November 21 is World Pancreatic Cancer Awareness Day. Pancreatic cancer is currently responsible for the 3rd highest amount of cancer deaths, and thus is an extremely deadly cancer in Australia. On this day, we are asking venues across the globe to turn purple to honour those lost to pancreatic cancer or currently fighting, as well as raise important awareness for this disease. With only a 12.5% chance of survival beyond 5 years.
