			<xCal:description>The Reddacliff Place sculptures will be lit all colours to recognise NAIDOC Week.

NAIDOC Week recognises and celebrates the culture, history, and achievements of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. NAIDOC Week will be held from 2-9 July 2023, honouring this year&amp;rsquo;s theme of &amp;lsquo;For Our Elders&amp;rsquo;.

Across every generation, our Elders have played, and continue to play an important role and hold a prominent place in our communities and families.

Elders play an extremely important role in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander families as care providers, educators, cultural knowledge holders, trailblazers, advocates, survivors, leaders, hard workers, role models and are strongly relied upon as key decision makers within families and communities. They hold the greatest respect because many of them experienced severe injustices to ensure succeeding generations do not suffer the same. It is through the Elders that the spirit of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people is kept alive.

We pay our respects to the Elders who have passed into the dreaming and to those who continue to provide strength, support and guidance for us all; we pay homage to them.

In 2023, how will you celebrate &amp;lsquo;For Our Elders&amp;rsquo;?

			<xCal:description>The Tropical Dome will be lit all colours to recognise NAIDOC Week.

NAIDOC Week recognises and celebrates the culture, history, and achievements of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. NAIDOC Week will be held from 2-9 July 2023, honouring this year&amp;rsquo;s theme of &amp;lsquo;For Our Elders&amp;rsquo;.

Across every generation, our Elders have played, and continue to play an important role and hold a prominent place in our communities and families.

Elders play an extremely important role in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander families as care providers, educators, cultural knowledge holders, trailblazers, advocates, survivors, leaders, hard workers, role models and are strongly relied upon as key decision makers within families and communities. They hold the greatest respect because many of them experienced severe injustices to ensure succeeding generations do not suffer the same. It is through the Elders that the spirit of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people is kept alive.

We pay our respects to the Elders who have passed into the dreaming and to those who continue to provide strength, support and guidance for us all; we pay homage to them.

In 2023, how will you celebrate &amp;lsquo;For Our Elders&amp;rsquo;?

NAIDOC Week recognises and celebrates the culture, history, and achievements of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. NAIDOC Week will be held from 2-9 July 2023, honouring this year&amp;rsquo;s theme of &amp;lsquo;For Our Elders&amp;rsquo;.

Across every generation, our Elders have played, and continue to play an important role and hold a prominent place in our communities and families.

Elders play an extremely important role in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander families as care providers, educators, cultural knowledge holders, trailblazers, advocates, survivors, leaders, hard workers, role models and are strongly relied upon as key decision makers within families and communities. They hold the greatest respect because many of them experienced severe injustices to ensure succeeding generations do not suffer the same. It is through the Elders that the spirit of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people is kept alive.

We pay our respects to the Elders who have passed into the dreaming and to those who continue to provide strength, support and guidance for us all; we pay homage to them.

In 2023, how will you celebrate &amp;lsquo;For Our Elders&amp;rsquo;?

NAIDOC Week recognises and celebrates the culture, history, and achievements of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. NAIDOC Week will be held from 2-9 July 2023, honouring this year&amp;rsquo;s theme of &amp;lsquo;For Our Elders&amp;rsquo;.

Across every generation, our Elders have played, and continue to play an important role and hold a prominent place in our communities and families.

Elders play an extremely important role in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander families as care providers, educators, cultural knowledge holders, trailblazers, advocates, survivors, leaders, hard workers, role models and are strongly relied upon as key decision makers within families and communities. They hold the greatest respect because many of them experienced severe injustices to ensure succeeding generations do not suffer the same. It is through the Elders that the spirit of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people is kept alive.

We pay our respects to the Elders who have passed into the dreaming and to those who continue to provide strength, support and guidance for us all; we pay homage to them.

In 2023, how will you celebrate &amp;lsquo;For Our Elders&amp;rsquo;?

			<xCal:description>The Victoria Bridge will be lit in the colours of the Aboriginal (red, black and yellow) and Torres Strait Islander Flag (white, blue, green, white) to recognise NAIDOC Week.

NAIDOC Week recognises and celebrates the culture, history, and achievements of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. NAIDOC Week will be held from 2-9 July 2023, honouring this year&amp;rsquo;s theme of &amp;lsquo;For Our Elders&amp;rsquo;.

Across every generation, our Elders have played, and continue to play an important role and hold a prominent place in our communities and families.

Elders play an extremely important role in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander families as care providers, educators, cultural knowledge holders, trailblazers, advocates, survivors, leaders, hard workers, role models and are strongly relied upon as key decision makers within families and communities. They hold the greatest respect because many of them experienced severe injustices to ensure succeeding generations do not suffer the same. It is through the Elders that the spirit of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people is kept alive.

We pay our respects to the Elders who have passed into the dreaming and to those who continue to provide strength, support and guidance for us all; we pay homage to them.

In 2023, how will you celebrate &amp;lsquo;For Our Elders&amp;rsquo;?

It is through the Elders that the spirit of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people is kept alive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We pay our respects to the Elders who have passed into the dreaming and to those who continue to provide strength, support and guidance for us all; we pay homage to them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 2023, how will you celebrate &amp;#8216;For Our Elders&amp;#8217;?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Light Up is organised by: Brisbane City Council &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Venue&lt;/b&gt;:&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="javascript:Nav(&amp;#39;objectid=266279&amp;amp;objecttype=19243&amp;amp;seotitle=Brisbane-City-Hall-Brisbane-City&amp;amp;key=65ee334ef4ba718a978e0c8387376cbf&amp;amp;view=object&amp;amp;-childview=&amp;amp;-index=&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;detailBase&amp;#39;)"&gt;Brisbane City Hall, Brisbane City&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Venue address&lt;/b&gt;:&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://maps.google.com/?q=-27.468957,153.023526(Brisbane+City+Hall%2c+Brisbane+City)" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Brisbane City Hall, 64 Adelaide Street, Brisbane City&lt;/a&gt;</description>

			<xCal:description>City Hall will be lit in the colours of the Aboriginal (red, black and yellow) and Torres Strait Islander Flag (white, blue, green, white) to recognise NAIDOC Week.

NAIDOC Week recognises and celebrates the culture, history, and achievements of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. NAIDOC Week will be held from 2-9 July 2023, honouring this year&amp;rsquo;s theme of &amp;lsquo;For Our Elders&amp;rsquo;.

Across every generation, our Elders have played, and continue to play an important role and hold a prominent place in our communities and families.

Elders play an extremely important role in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander families as care providers, educators, cultural knowledge holders, trailblazers, advocates, survivors, leaders, hard workers, role models and are strongly relied upon as key decision makers within families and communities. They hold the greatest respect because many of them experienced severe injustices to ensure succeeding generations do not suffer the same. It is through the Elders that the spirit of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people is kept alive.

We pay our respects to the Elders who have passed into the dreaming and to those who continue to provide strength, support and guidance for us all; we pay homage to them.

In 2023, how will you celebrate &amp;lsquo;For Our Elders&amp;rsquo;?

Orange Sky July is our national campaign to raise money and awareness of people experiencing homelessness From sitting down on our orange chairs and chatting with friends, we&amp;#39;ve learnt that although access to laundry and shower services is important, it&amp;#39;s the conversation and regular connection that create the biggest impact in the community.

The Queensland Maroons won the bragging rights to last year&amp;#39;s State of Origin by winning the Game I at Accor Stadium and Game III at Suncorp. The New South Wales Blues convincingly won Game II at Optus Stadium in Perth.&amp;nbsp; Adelaide Oval is hosting Game I, 2023 as we watch with anticipation to see who will secure the early lead. We know who we are backing! You&amp;#39;ve got this Queensland!

			<xCal:description>City Hall will be lit Blue, Pink and White to support eve of National Pyjama Day.

National Pyjama Day is all about wearing your favourite pair of PJ&amp;rsquo;s to help The Pyjama Foundation raise much needed awareness and funds for children in foster care.

The Pyjama Foundation supports the educational outcomes for children in foster care through the Love of Learning Program. Volunteers, known as Pyjama Angels, spend time with children in care once a week reading books aloud, playing educational games and engaging in fun learning-based activities. Most importantly, a Pyjama Angels role is to provide consistent friendship and support for the child, teaching them that they are valued.
