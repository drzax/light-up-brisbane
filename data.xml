Go Dotty Day 2025 - Our nationally recognised "Go Dotty Day" on 2nd October annually raises awareness of Ladybird Care Foundation and the support we provide to bereaved parents. The date, 2nd October coincides with the birthday of Emma Pascoe, daughter of the founders of Ladybird Care Foundation. Emma passed away just before her 18th birthday and is the inspiration for Ladybird Care Foundation, who provides bereavement care to parents who have lost a child (of any age) through our Peer Mentoring program.

We focus on strengths&amp;mdash;not symptoms&amp;mdash;supporting members to reconnect with family, friendships, education, employment, housing, and community life. We invite you to join us on October 9th for A Night to Nourish&amp;mdash;a gala to reduce stigma, increase understanding, and raise funds for a commercial-grade kitchen at our newest North-side Clubhouse. More than a place to prepare meals, this kitchen will be a hub for hospitality training, nutritious food, and meaningful connection&amp;mdash;supporting recovery through purpose and belonging.

This Light Up is organised by: Stepping Stones Clubhouse</xCal:description>

The initiative is linked to World Mental Health Day, which is held on 10 October every year. Queensland Mental Health Week encourages all of us to think about our mental health and wellbeing, regardless of whether we may have a lived experience of mental illness or not, and encourages help seeking behaviours, when needed. The week also gives us the opportunity to understand the importance of mental health in our everyday lives. It affects how we think, feel, and act. It also helps determine how we handle stress, relate to others, and make choices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Light Up is organised by: Checkup Australia &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Light up asset&lt;/b&gt;:&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="javascript:Nav(&amp;#39;objectid=964835&amp;amp;objecttype=19243&amp;amp;seotitle=Story-Bridge-Kangaroo-Point&amp;amp;key=007c3d18c863bafaddf8444539526a01&amp;amp;view=object&amp;amp;-childview=&amp;amp;-index=&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;detailBase&amp;#39;)"&gt;Story Bridge, Kangaroo Point&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Venue address&lt;/b&gt;:&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://maps.google.com/?q=-27.463298,153.035756(Story+Bridge%2c+Kangaroo+Point)" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Story Bridge, Main Street, Kangaroo Point&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Venue type&lt;/b&gt;:&amp;nbsp;General Council venue, Light up asset</description>

Queensland Mental Health Week (QMHW) is an annual awareness week that aims to shine a spotlight on individual and community mental health and wellbeing. The initiative is linked to World Mental Health Day, which is held on 10 October every year. Queensland Mental Health Week encourages all of us to think about our mental health and wellbeing, regardless of whether we may have a lived experience of mental illness or not, and encourages help seeking behaviours, when needed. The week also gives us the opportunity to understand the importance of mental health in our everyday lives. It affects how we think, feel, and act. It also helps determine how we handle stress, relate to others, and make choices.
